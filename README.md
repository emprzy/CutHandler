# CutHandler 🥏 ✂️
The ultimate auto-clipping tool! 

Installation of the `cuthandler` package will make two distinct commands available for lossless(!) clipping of your footage:
* `cuthandler-clip` which will clip your source video(s) into individual video files, and
* `cuthandler-xml` which will encode clippings from your source video(s) into XML files that can be imported and used as a sequence in Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro.
